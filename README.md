This assingment deals with the merging and cleaning of multiple data sets.

First, we read into R each of the individual data sets, and than merge them approapriatly.

Than, we tidy up the data sets and name the columns in a way that makes sense.
In particular , we only focus on columns that contain information about mean and standard deviation.

Finally, we summarize our data into a tidy data frame with appropriate labels.
